# Naturescape: Natural Soundscapes to the Desktop
## Project brief:
The Project: Students and staff of the university (and elsewhere) experience significant levels of stress in their daily activities. Research shows that being exposed to a natural environment even if only for a short while rapidly relieves from stress and mental fatigue. While it is difficult to get exposure to nature while working in a lab, in an office or in your flat, there is evidence that listening to natural sounds on its own provides similar benefits.

In this project you will produce a program that brings natural sounds to peopleâ€™s desktops via a highly-customisable soundscape generator. The program will continuously generate sounds, obtained by mixing natural sounds (such as bird singing sounds, rain and water noises, wind, waves on a beach, etc.) in a pseudo-random, pleasing manner If the project is successful, it will be used by many people around the University and beyond.
